# FullCycle temperature system
Get temperature by CEP

# ‚öôÔ∏è Setting up

- Execute the command: `make prepare`
- Fill up with your credentials in these files: `env.dev.json` and `env.prod.json`
- We have this JSON example, you must change these variables for `dev` and `prod`:
  ```json
  {
    "temperature" : {
      "url": "https://api.weatherapi.com",
      "api_key": "***"
    },
    "cep": {
      "url": "https://viacep.com.br"
    }
  }
  ```

- Finally, you can run one of these commands:
  - `make run-dev`: to use credentials from `env.dev.json`
  - `make run-prod`: to use credentials from `env.prod.json`

# üß™ Testing in Local
- After you **start** the application, you can test it.
- We are using the `:8080` port for local/dev environment.
- We have this endpoint: `/temperature` in `GET` method to get the temperature by CEP, you can use it:
  - `${API_URL}/temperature?cep=58070-310`
  - We have this successfully response:
    ```json
    {
      "location": "Jo√£o Pessoa",
      "temp_C": 25,
      "temp_F": 77,
      "temp_K": 298
    }
    ```
- You can run the api integration test by running one of these commands:
  - Local: ```API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080 go test -v ./tests/integration```
  - Production: ```API_URL=https://temperature-uz6otgp6yq-uc.a.run.app go test -v ./tests/integration```
- You can change the local URL, the production URL is the app that is running in the Google Cloud.

# üöÄ Deploy to GCP Cloud Run
- Set these variables on your favourite shell:
  - `ENV_PROJECT_ID`: This is the projectID that you are using, for example in my case is: `generic-316622`
  - `ENV_ARG`: this is the environment variable, you can use either `prod` or `dev`.
- You need to log to gcloud using `gcloud auth login`
- Then, run `gcloud config set project ${ENV_PROJECT_ID}`
- You need to execute `deploy.sh` by running this: (you must change `ENV_PROJECT_ID`)
  ```shell
  ENV_PROJECT_ID=generic-316622 ENV_ARG=prod ./deploy.sh
  ```
- For this project, we have this URL to test using `GET` method
  ```
  https://temperature-uz6otgp6yq-uc.a.run.app/temperature?cep=58070-310
  ```
